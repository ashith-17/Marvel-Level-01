## Task 1 - Linear and Logistic Regression - HelloWorld for AIML
### Linear Regression
Linear regression is a supervised machine-learning algorithm that learns from the labelled datasets and maps the data points to the most optimized linear functions, which can be used for prediction on new datasets. First off we should know what supervised machine learning algorithms is. It is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labelled data.  Labeled data means the dataset whose respective target value(y) is already known.

The goal of the linear regression algorithm is to find the best Fit Line equation that can predict the values based on the independent variables.  

#  

In regression set of records are present with X and Y values and these values are used to learn a function so if you want to predict Y from an unknown X this learned function can be used. In regression we have to find the value of Y, So, a function is required that predicts continuous Y in the case of regression given X as independent features.

Later in task 5,I learned it from scratch.For a basic idea I  predicted the price of perth houses based on multiple different variables using sci-kit’s linear_model.LinearRegression().
